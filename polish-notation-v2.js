exports.calculate = function(expression) {
    // expected inputs are string expressions
    // these string expressions consist of operators and operands

    // the string expressions are an alternative notation for representing arthimetic to remove the need for (parentheses)

    // the expected output should be a numerical value (i.e. JavaScript primitive number-type)
    // the logic needs to pass the tests that expect the same numerical value when evaluated using standard PEMDAS

    // Reasoning:
    // since this 'alternative' prefix notation of performing math relies on prefixing the numbers (i.e. operands) with their respective operators
    // this requirement lends itself towards using a stack-approach implemented with a JS dynamic array
